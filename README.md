# SemanticUI-Template

This repository contains the source code for a empty webpage using Semantic UI. You can find more information about Semantic UI [here](https://semantic-ui.com/).

I simply did a build of Semantic UI (version 2.4.2) with Gulp and took the output minified CSS and JS files.

## Liscene

Use this for anything you like. It's just a few simple files with a build of Semantic UI, so I didn't do much and don't expect (or deserve) any credit.
